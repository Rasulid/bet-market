# Bet Market

## Introduction

Bet Market is a FastAPI application that allows users to place bets on sports events, track the history of their bets, and see updates on event outcomes. This project demonstrates how to use FastAPI with Docker and interact with a PostgreSQL database asynchronously.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rasulid/bet-market.git
cd bet-market
docker-compose up --build
